          I decided to make hull using the traditional method of planking over frames. I made 10 frames over the 650mm length of the hull, with the hope that the close spacing would eliminate the need for stringers. To generate the pattens for the the frames I printed out the cross section of the hull I drew at regular intervals. The templates were glued to 3mm fibre board. I cut out the frames with a coping saw then sanded them to the line. I then glued them to some cuboid blocks made from machined pine. The frames were aligned to a line on a board of wood using a square and clamped in place to glue. Finally the edges of the frames were covered in clear plastic tape to prevent the epoxy adhering to them.
